Maggie made a mistake while trying to force a push and it deleted some commits,
including most of Harry's, so they don't show up in the commit history anymore,
and we had to push our work again so it looks like we made massive commits 
instead of the multiple smaller ones we actually did. Most of Harry's work on
part 2 that did not make it into the final version is now on a branch called
harryGetResult.
